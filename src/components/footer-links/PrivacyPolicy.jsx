                With more natural resource provisions in peace agreements today,
                it is also clear that there is a need for the international
                community and peacekeeping operations in particular to build new
                capacities and partnerships to be able to support the
                implementation of these provisions. The report concludes that
                addressing the risks and opportunities presented by natural
                resources is often critical to the success of UN peacekeeping
                efforts and can no longer be seen as distinct from the
                maintenance of peace and security. At the same time, the report
                also highlights the positive efforts that have been undertaken
                to reduce the environmental impacts of UN peacekeeping
                operations. By adopting creative and transformational practices,
                technologies and behaviours, peacekeeping missions can curtail
                energy and water use and waste production, and also generate
                significant financial savings. The improved health, safety and
                security of local communities and personnel, self-sufficiency of
                camps and reduced potential for disputes with local communities
                are further benefits. The two parts of the report are inherently
                connected showcasing better environmental practices and
                minimizing the impacts of peacekeeping operations are necessary
                prerequisites and form a foundation for engagement and building
                confidence at the community level.
