        <p className="mb-6">
          The United Nations Organization embodies the aspirations of all the
          people of the world for peace. In this context, the United Nations
          Charter requires that all personnel maintain the highest standards of
          integrity and conduct.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          We will comply with the Guidelines on International Humanitarian Law
          for Forces Undertaking United Nations Peacekeeping Operations and the
          applicable portions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as
          the fundamental basis of our standards.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          We, as peacekeepers, represent the United Nations and are present in
          the country to help it recover from the trauma of a conflict. As a
          result, we must consciously be prepared to accept special constraints
          in our public and private lives in order to do the work and to pursue
          the ideals of the United Nations Organization.
