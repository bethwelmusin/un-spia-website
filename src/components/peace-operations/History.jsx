                It was on May 31, 2018 that the UN Soldiers of Peace
                International Association (AISP/SPIA) was at the Palais des
                Nations in Geneva, bringing together more than 350 people to
                celebrate the International Day of Peacekeepers . This day
                particularly marked the history of the NGO and all the Blue
                Helmets since it celebrated the 70th anniversary of peacekeeping
                operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The International Association of Peacekeepers is an NGO
                recognized by the general status of the Economic and Social
                Council of the United Nations whose aim is to bring together all
                the Blue Helmets of all countries and unite them to serve the
                Charter of the United Nations. The AISP/SPIA has celebrated this
                day every year since 2002 under the sign of peace, honoring the
                service rendered by these soldiers. The International Day of
                Peacekeepers was created after the AISP/SPIA submitted a
                proposal, taken up by member countries of the United Nations
                General Assembly , to symbolically inscribe in the memories a
                day that would be dedicated to the celebration of the
                Peacekeepers. It was then that in 2002, the UN General Assembly
                established an International Day of Peacekeepers by voting on
                resolution 57/129 , every May 29. This date being that of the
                first peacekeeping operation. Peacekeepers protect civilians,
                actively prevent conflict, reduce violence, strengthen security
                and empower national authorities to assume these
                responsibilities. This requires a coherent security and
                peacebuilding strategy that supports the political strategy. UN
                peacekeeping helps host countries to become more resilient to
                conflict, laying the groundwork to sustain long-term peace,
                including by addressing root causes of conflict.
              </p>

              <p>
                The aim of this day is: <br></br>
                -To honor the memory of the UN Blue Helmets who lost their lives
                in the service of peace.<br></br>
                -To pay tribute to all those men and women who have served and
                continue to serve in UN peacekeeping operations for their
                professionalism, dedication and courage.<br></br>
                -This is why May 29 is International Peacekeepers Day. Let us
                recall that this day also took place in Russia, the Czech
                Republic, Poland, Belgium and the United Kingdom.

                Mr. Laurent Attar Bayrou, President of AISP/SPIA, present
                alongside Mrs. Darrieussecq, Secretary of State for the Armed
                Forces in charge of veterans for the presentation of the stamp
                at the Hôtel de Brienne, headquarters of the Ministry of the
                Armed Forces.<br></br>
                On the occasion of this international day of May 29, AISP/SPIA
                in partnership with the Post Office, was able to launch in
                France a stamp paying tribute to the Blue Helmets. This ceremony
                took place at the Hôtel de Brienne, headquarters of the Ministry
                of the Armed Forces, in the presence of Mrs. Darrieussecq,
                Secretary of State for the Armed Forces in charge of veterans.
                The Minister was able to unveil the stamp, and we also had the
                opportunity to present our exhibition to her. The day continued
                under the Arc de Triomphe for a rekindling of the flame, paying
                tribute to all the Blue Helmets.<br></br>
                The International Day of Peacekeepers began on the morning of 31
                May 2018, at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. It began with an
                opening speech by Mr. Oscar Ivanova , Project and International
                Relations Officer at AISP /SPIA, who notably greeted all the
                guests, including Blue Helmets and civilians, and was able to
                present the programme for the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Laurent ATTAR BAYROU , President of AISP/SPIA, during his
                speech, reminded us of the challenges of peacekeeping for 70
                years and the sacrifices of the soldiers who served under the
                colors of the United Nations in the name of peace. He also
                presented the programs offered by the NGO: Young Peacemakers,
                Sports and Health for the Promotion of Peace, Peace Academy,
                ASSEO, Environment and Humanitarian. Afterwards, a short
                ceremony took place in a solemn atmosphere and recalling the
                very important sense of honour among these soldiers. The
                President had the opportunity to award a French blue helmet to a
                member of the Czech delegation following a long-standing
                promise. The day then continued, between the younger generation
                and seasoned soldiers, towards a photo session in front of the
                famous aligned flags of the United Nations and in front of the
                Globe monument in the garden of the Palace. These moments gave
                us the impression of ultimately having only one common goal:
                that of peace. We were all gathered and united in the heart of
                this place that is the Palace of Nations, known to all and
                symbolically representing the maintenance of Peace. We could
                feel the admiration and wonder of the children present but also
                the euphoria of the Blue Helmet soldiers from all over the world
                to be united for this same cause carried in the hearts of all.
                In the second part of the day, the celebration continued with
                the grand ceremony of raising the United Nations flag and laying
                the wreath.

                During the ceremony, the Blue Helmets arrived in a military
                manner and lined up to be decorated. Observing this ceremony
                from a breathtaking view, we were struck by the soldiers coming
                forward to receive their decoration since not all Blue Helmet
                soldiers have the same type of march depending on their country
                of origin. Then came the laying of the wreath at the foot of the
                monument commemorating " the memory of those who gave their
                lives for peace ". While all the soldiers stood around this
                monument, Ms. Corinne Momal-Vanian , Director of Conferences of
                the United Nations, addressed us with a speech in honor of the
                Blue Helmets and the maintenance of peace in the world. A great
                moment for the children and civilians present but also for these
                soldiers who remember more than anyone the sacrifices and
                dedication that a Blue Helmet can demonstrate during his
                service. A conference finally took place around 4:00 p.m.
                Ambassadors from several countries were present as well as the
                Blue Helmets and invited civilians. Ms. Corinne Momal-Vanian and
                Mr. Laurent Attar Bayrou led the conference which began with a
                video message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations,
                Mr. Antonio Guterres . All were invited to testify or speak to
                discuss the concept of peace and for some of the experience they
                wished to share.

                In addition, a choir of young Russian girls did us the pleasure
                of being present to accompany the ceremonies of this day with
                traditional songs. After listening to them during the
                flag-raising ceremony, they performed other songs for us,
                sometimes in English, sometimes even in French, during this
                conference within the United Nations. We finally went early in
                the evening to a cinema in the heart of Geneva to watch the film
                " Until Peace Reigns " by Melonie Kastman, a documentary about
                the peacekeeping operation that took place in the Democratic
                Republic of Congo. This documentary film was very interesting
                and allowed us to see the reality of the actions on the ground
                for an audience that was not very concerned by this environment.
                For the Blue Helmets, it was an intense moment since they were
                able to recall memories of their own mission. Finally, the
                general in charge of the mission was present, so we had the
                chance to talk with him about the subject. In short, this day
                was an opportunity for everyone to come together for a cause as
                important as peace. The concept of peace must endure over time
                and go through history. 70 years have passed since the first
                mission of the Blue Helmets in 1948. It is also 3,500 soldiers,
                police officers and civilians who have lost their lives in the
                service of peace. This day is a way to continue to honor each
                year, these soldiers who have shown dedication, courage and
                sacrifice in favor of peace.
