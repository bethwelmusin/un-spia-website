                Tragically, over 3,500 peacekeepers have lost their lives in the
                cause of peace. Their sacrifice on behalf of the international
                community are one of the most concrete expressions of the UN
                Charter’s determination “to save succeeding generations from the
                scourge of war.” You can find about the nationality and the
                missions they served in the fatalities data section.{" "}

              <p className="font-bold">Women in Peacekeeping</p>
              <p>
                Women are deployed in all areas – police, military and civilian
                – and have made a positive impact on peacekeeping environments,
                including in supporting the role of women in building peace and
                protecting women's rights. In all fields of peacekeeping, women
                peacekeepers have proven that they can perform the same roles,
                to the same standards and under the same difficult conditions,
                as their male counterparts. It is an operational imperative that
                we recruit and retain female peacekeepers. In 1993, women made
                up 1% of deployed uniformed personnel. <br></br>In 2020, out of
                approximately 95,000 peacekeepers, women constitute 4.8% of
                military contingents, 10.9% of formed police units and 34% of
                justice and corrections government-provided personnel in UN
                Peacekeeping missions.<br></br> While the UN encourages and advocates for
                the deployment of women to uniformed functions, the
                responsibility for deployment of women in the police and
                military lies with Member States. UN Police Division launched
                'the Global Effort' to recruit more female police officers into
                national police services and into UN police operations around
                the world.<br></br> The 2028 target for women serving in military
                contingents is 15%, and 25% for military observers and staff
                officers. The 2028 target for women serving in formed police
                units is 20%, and 30% for individual police officers. Find out

                breakdown of the number of male and female uniformed personnel
                working across our missions.

                International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers
              </p>

              <p>
                Each year on the 29 May we celebrate the International Day of
                United Nations Peacekeepers. The day was established to honour
                the memory of the UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives in
                the cause of peace; and to pay tribute to all the men and women
                who have served and continue to serve in UN peacekeeping
                operations for their high level of professionalism, dedication
                and courage. The UN General Assembly designated Peacekeepers Day
                in 2002 [A/RES/57/129]. In recent years, we have encouraged the
                celebration of the Day under a common theme:

              <p>
                The UN expects that all peacekeeping personnel adhere to the
                highest standards of behaviour and conduct themselves in a
                professional and disciplined manner at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Special training is required to ensure that UN personnel are
                equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to
                perform these diverse duties and to be prepared for particularly
                challenging situations. There are several types of required
                training from pre-deployment which covers basic UN principles,
                guidelines and policies to more targeted trainings related to
                specific issues such as sexual abuse and exploitation. These
                required trainings set standards for UN peacekeeping and guide
                personnel as they carry out critical tasks to assist the
                countries within which they work.
