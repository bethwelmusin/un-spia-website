          It is that time of the year again. World leaders converged in New York for the launch of the 79th U.N. General Assembly. 
          With every passing year, the global trends away from multilateral approaches and structures that ensure peace, security, 
          and global stability leave humanity in a growing state of precarity. That, however, should demand a penetrating call for 
          less cynicism, not more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past decade or so, the U.N. General Assembly's high-level debates have emphasized multilateral action toward ambitious, 
          often abstract, targets like the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The themes 
          of the last two UNGAs highlight ongoing efforts to unite nations in addressing intertwined global issues — like climate change, 
          poverty, and inequality — through multilateral frameworks like the SDGs. A consistent thread throughout these themes emphasizes 
          progress at the global level realized through effective collective state action via multilateral institutions, with a focus on 
          creating fair, sustainable societies where the rights and needs of each person are upheld.
        </p>

        <p>
          Success at these two levels — consensus on global policy and protecting individual rights — seems to be far out of reach. The rise 
          of isolationism, regionalism, and "minilateralism" threaten to erode the multilateral cooperation the U.N. relies on. Meanwhile, 
          individual rights are increasingly compromised by the resurgence of authoritarian regimes and great power competition, which can 
          lead to prioritizing alliances with governments with poor human rights records.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this year’s UNGA theme focuses on “leaving no one behind,” an alternative theme that might resonate just as deeply with the 
          atmosphere of our time could be drawn from art historian Linda Nochlin's seminal work, “The Body in Pieces: The Fragment as a Metaphor 
          for Modernity.” In many ways, the global landscape today mirrors Nochlin’s metaphor of fragmentation: trust between nations, institutions, 
          and people is fractured, while global systems, much like the body in 19th-century art, appear to break apart under the weight of geopolitical, 
          environmental, and societal crises.
        </p>

        <p>
          Much will be needed to bring it back. It can’t be done alone, and it requires strong American leadership. There is no better time than now, 
          and a good faith effort at this year’s Summit of the Future is a great place to start.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">An Urgent Call to Address Tomorrow’s Challenges</h2>

        <p>
          The “Summit for the Future,” which will be held concurrently with this year’s UNGA, is a cornerstone of Secretary-General António Guterres' 
          vision for "Our Common Agenda," first unveiled in September 2021. The agenda calls for broad commitments to reform and strengthen the 
          international system, aiming to address emerging challenges like climate change, technological inequality, and the erosion of multilateralism.
        </p>

        <p>
          The summit aims to address rapid advances in technology and science, which offer great potential for a more peaceful and prosperous future, 
          but also pose threats and opportunities that must be carefully managed through multilateral approaches.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is easy to treat the Summit for the Future cynically, especially given competing foreign policy priorities like the wars in Sudan, Gaza, 
          and Ukraine that tend to eclipse long-term initiatives like youth development, fragile state stability, and equitable technology use.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Generations and Geopolitics</h2>

        <p>
          Taking the future seriously means recognizing shifting power dynamics — both generationally and geopolitically. These shifts are particularly 
          evident in calls for things like Security Council reform, which the Pact for the Future aims to garner commitment on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the long run, young people will bear the brunt of many of today's challenges; they also frequently have the most innovative ideas for addressing 
          these challenges. The Summit for the Future will incorporate youth leadership like never before through “The Summit of the Future Action Days.”
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Updating the U.N. for a New World Order</h2>

        <p>
          The post-World War II system was built on principles that were revolutionary at the time — promoting peace, stability, and the safeguarding of 
          individual rights through an international system.
        </p>

        <p>
          The AI revolution is upending every sector of society — from automating jobs and decision-making processes to enhancing military and surveillance 
          capabilities. AI is rewriting the rules of engagement in governance, economy, and security. And this is just the beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
          These developments demand a rethinking of the systems that were put in place to prevent global conflict, as they now operate in a fundamentally 
          different world.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">U.S. Leadership is Needed</h2>

        <p>
          The U.S. should work closely with other permanent members of the Security Council and member states to address long-standing calls for reform. 
          This involves acknowledging other countries' reform proposals, including those that advocate for more inclusive veto powers or a rebalancing 
          of regional representation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to Security Council reform, the U.S. can champion youth empowerment at the Summit for the Future. Building on ideas already floated, 
          the U.S. should make a strong pledge to support formal structures that institutionalize youth participation in multilateral decision-making processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today’s challenges demand new approaches to peace and security, ones that allow for flexibility, incorporate diverse perspectives, and empower the 
          next generation to reshape global systems.
